\bibitem{notes} Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition: Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We
present a residual learning framework to ease the training
of networks that are substantially deeper than those used
previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning
residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead
of learning unreferenced functions, 2015
