# Generating 3D Models With Deep Neural Networks
This is a research that purposes a proper mathematical approach to representing 3D meshes as coordinates in 3D space. This way we can feed into and train Neural Networks easier than other approaches using voxels. Paper coming soon.
# Still In Experimental State
